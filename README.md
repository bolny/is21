## Take Home Assignment

The basic structure of this assignment is to create a web application and deploy
it to a cloud platform. My intention is to use Github Actions with Terraform to
deploy the application to AWS. The application will consist of three services, a
front end deployed to a docker container in an EC2 instance, a back end deployed
to a docker container in an EC2 instance, and a database instance in RDS.
